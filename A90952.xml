         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Anſwered by <hi>George Preſſick</hi> of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUt before I come to anſwer his Arguments, whereby he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove what is above written in his Title Page; I ſhall if the Lord will be pleaſed to inable me, from ſeveral Texts of Scripture that points out Antichriſt, and without Wire-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Text, ſhew you how we may know Antichriſt, who he is, and were he is: and when as near as can be gathered from the circumſtances of time, place and paſſages concerning him, when he firſt appeared.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to that, I muſt crave the Readers patience to take notice of ſome paſſages in his Title Page, and in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; as to his Title Page, I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That if the <hi>Biſhop</hi> could prove what he aſſerts <hi>viz.</hi> that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, was never before this time diſcovered; and if he had the art to perſwade men to believe him, in ſo doing he ſhould do the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> (who will appeare to be Antichriſt) more ſervice, then all his Cardinals and Roman Clergy could ever do for him this Thouſand years; for ſo long he hath been ſuſpected to be the Antichriſt: for I doubt not but I ſhall make it appear that he had his birth at the leaſt fifteen hundred years agone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas he ſaith that the Aſſembly of Presbyterians at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> together with Independants, Anabaptiſts and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachers, and the Long parliament; that they have fulfilled all the Propheſies of Scripture which have fore-ſpoken of the coming of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That what he ſaith of theſe perſons, is as true and no truer, then the next following words that he ſpeaks of the above-named perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> That they United and Combined themſelves together by <hi>A Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> to ſlay the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and Chriſt; for I think that he will never be able to make that appear, that there is any ſuch Clauſe or Article in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as to bind them that took it, to ſlay the two Witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt; or that that was the end and aim for which it was taken, when it was taken; but as to other things I am ſo far from excuſing them, that I do confeſſe that many of the Parliament, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151652:2"/>Anabaptiſts and Lay-preachers, were both Hypocritical and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical: and it is well known to moſt part of the Biſhops in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to ſome in <hi>England,</hi> that I did Write and Print three Books againſt Anabaptiſts and Lay-preachers even when they were in their greateſt proſperitie; that no Biſhop that I knew but one, did appear in publick againſt them; for I was alwaies perſwaded that the chief Ring-leaders of them were of an Antichriſtian brood, either Jeſuits or Friars: and I wiſh the Church be free of them now.</p>
            <p>In his Epiſtle to the Reader, he ſaith, <hi>That he hath long studied, and long prayed to know the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that fore-told of the coming of Antichriſt, and that he might have the true underſtanding of them, who Antichriſt ſhould be, where he ſhould riſe, what feats he ſhould do, how long he ſhould continue, by what means he ſhould be ſubdued and deſtroyed;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>he now believes God hath granted his requeſt, and that he hath rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained theſe Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer</hi> with the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected alwaies in a good thing;</hi> So if his zeal and ſtudy had been guided to a right object, it had been well. But the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> tells us, <hi>that the heart of man is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked;</hi> therefore it is dangerous, leaſt it miſtake out of an over-valluing opinion of ſome worth in ones ſelf, or the prevalence of their prayers; eſpecially when a man hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a prejudicate opinion either of perſons or things: and I think it will appear upon trial, that he hath miſſed the mark in finding out who the Antichriſt ſhould be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we ſhall ſee hereafter, and his faith whereby he ſaid he believed that God had granted him rightly to explain theſe Scriptures. I think he might do well once more to examine whether that faith were not a fiction; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that part of his prayer, where he prayed, that if his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in explaining theſe Scriptures might not be for Gods glory, that it might be like the untimely birth of a Woman, that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before it ſee the Sun: And ſo I hope it will periſh, and never gain credit with any man of underſtanding that needs it.</p>
            <p>But ſome men are like <hi>Balaam,</hi> they mind not what anſwer God returns to their prayers; but firſt reſolves with themſelves to go on in ſuch or ſuch a deſigne, and then all after go to God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as though they would ſeek direction from him: when they have reſolved before hand thus and thus they will do: like <hi>Joha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> the ſon of <hi>Kareah,</hi> and the reſt of the Captains and people of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151652:3"/>
               <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they intreated the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to pray to the Lord for them, that the Lord would ſhew them the way wherein they ſhould walk, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. and promiſed the Prophet they would do whatſoever the Lord ſhould ſend unto them by the Prophet for to do; and yet they were reſolved before hand that what anſwer ſoever they received from the Lord, into <hi>Egypt</hi> they would go: and therefore the Prophet tells them, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Surely ye diſſembled in your hearts when you ſent me unto the Lord your God, ſaying, pray for us unto the Lord our God, and declare unto us even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and we will doe it;</hi> and I have this day declared it unto you, but you have not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the voice of the Lord your God, nor any thing, for the which he hath ſent me unto you: the reaſon was, becauſe Gods anſwer did not ſute with their former Reſolutions: therefore they told the Prophet he ſpake falſly, the Lord had not ſent unto him to ſay unto them go not into <hi>Egypt:</hi> and thus it was with many men, as to the anſwer of their prayers, when they are intended before that, ſuch a thing they will do, and then they go to prayer to ſeek direction from God: and it may be for once God anſwers by ſome notion in prayer contrary to their intended purpoſe, as he did <hi>Balaam</hi> the firſt time: but they will not take this for an anſwer becauſe it ſuits not with their mind, but have a hankering the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and will yet go again as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, and ſeek for divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and trie concluſions again and again as <hi>Balaam</hi> did: and then oftentimes they are encouraged to go on in their own way to their own hurt; and thus it fares oftentimes with men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſeeking of Wives or Husbands. Firſt, They reſolve what they will doe, and then they will pray to God for direction, and ask friends adviſe, when they are reſolved for what they will doe, let God and Friends adviſe and do what they will: I know ſome hath ſmarted for ſo doing, this is a point ought well to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all men in every weighty undertaking.</p>
            <p>Again, he ſaith in his Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>That if the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian can give him ſatisfaction that he is miſtaken, he will willingly recant and be ſorry for his error; but withal,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>he aſſures himſelf that the Beast with all his power, and the falſe Prophet with all his skill, ſhall not be able to do it; that is, to give him ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that he is miſtaken,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that in theſe very expreſſions of his is proved the truth of what I have writ above, that many men firſt reſolve what they will doe, and then they will by prayer ſeek direction from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151652:3"/>God, and from friends: ſo here the Biſhop promiſes that if the Presbyterian can give him ſatisfaction that he is miſtaken, he will recant; but he is reſolved and aſſured before hand, that they ſhall not give him ſatisfaction with all their power and skill. And it cannot be expected that the beaſt or falſe prophet will ever ſhew the Biſhop his miſtake; for in ſo doing Antechriſt the Pope, who is the beaſt or falſe prophet ſhould act againſt himſelf, to the ruine of his own kingdom; nay, the beaſt will rather ſtroke his head, and hug him, as we uſe to ſay, as the Divel hug'd the Witch, for the good ſervice he hath done him in taking ſo much pains to excuſe him, that we ſhould not think him to be the Antichriſt, and when he dies he will cannonize him with <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> for another Engliſh or Welſh Saint.</p>
            <p>But to deal engeniouſly and truly with you, though I confeſs I have heard ſome of every ſort preach, yet was I never united and joyned in Church-fellowſhip neither with Presbyterian, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Anabaptiſt, or Lay-preacher as yet; and therefore being I am none of them, I will endeavour in the ſtrength, and by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance (I hope) of the Spirit of God, to ſhew you your miſtake; and if you be ſo wedded to your own opinion that you will not be ſatisfied, yet it may perhaps ſatisfie ſome others, and then my labour will not be loſt, therefore I am reſolved to put it to the triall; yet it cannot be expected that I ſhould anſwer every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular whimſey and cavill that is in his book, for there is much Greek and Latine in it, and I was never ſo great a Scholler as to underſtand either Greek or Latine, and therefore I muſt intreat the Chriſtian Reader to bear with my weakneſs, if I doe miſcall ſome words, or not ſpell them right, and endeavour to pick out the ſenſe. Neither will I anſwer all nor half of what he hath writ in Engliſh, but ſo much as I think may give ſatisfaction to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader to judge whether the Biſhop or I be moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>
            <p>And as I ſaid above, we will in the firſt place ſee what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay as to this buſineſs, to ſhew who is Antichriſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſaid in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. as ye have heard that Antichriſt ſhall come,

<note place="margin">Forbidding marriage the doctrine of devils.</note> and which doctrine the holy Ghoſt in the word of truth tells us is the doctrine of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, that is, of Popes ſucceeding one another, and teaching that doctrine; and that they that teach it, are apoſtatized and fallen from the true faith, and are hypocritical liars, and ſeducers of Millions of ſouls, and all to eſtabliſh himſelf in his curſed Throne; thoſe that think the Pope not to be Antichriſt, I deſire them to rouſe up their ſpirits, and rub the ſcales from their eyes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how lively here and elſe where, as ſhall be ſhewed, how the Apoſtle hath drawn Antichriſtes Picture in every point and limb, ſo juſt like the Pope, that all men that reads may ſay this is he; That marriage inſtituted of God in innocency, honoured by Chriſts preſence at <hi>Canaan</hi> in <hi>Galile,</hi> the ſeed plot of the Church, the allowed remedy againſt incontinency and luſt, and which the the Apoſtle commands as honourable in all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. and yet forbidden by the Pope, the Scarlot Strumpit of <hi>Rome</hi> to all the whole Clergy.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Mark or Character the Apoſtle layes down to know Antichriſt by, is that, as he forbids marriage. So ſecondly, He commands abſtinence from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanks-giving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which words declare thus much unto us, that neither Marriage nor Meats, nor any other Creature, nor Ordinance of God is to be refuſed upon any tye of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, provided, they be received with thanks-giving of them that believe and know the truth, with ſuch other requiſite conditions as becometh Chriſtians; in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 25. the holy Apoſtle bids us, <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles, that eat, asking no queſtion for Conſcience ſake,</hi> &amp;c. and Titus 1.15. <hi>To the pure, all things are pure;</hi> ſo that to forbear the uſe out of a tye of Conſcience, or a Superſtious Opinion, as being unlawful at ſuch or ſuch a time; it is againſt Chriſtian libert, either to charge the uſe of them with ſin, or to place holineſs in abſtaining from the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>It is the Doctrine you ſee the Apoſtle tells of, that Antichriſt ſhould teach, and this is the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>'s doctrine; for he ſaith, it is a ſinne deſerving death to eat of meats prohibited by the Church they teach, that faſting conſiſts only in abſtinance from meats, and not from drink; I have ſeen them, that upon one of their Superſtitious faſting dayes, they would eat no meat but they would eat plentifully of Fruit, Raiſons of the Sun, and Figs, and the like, and drink largely of Wine, Ale and Beer; and ſuch kind of Faſting with them is eſteemed ſatisfactory for ſin, and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151652:6"/>of eternal Life; and this is another Hypocritical mark or Charracter of Antichriſt, for ſuch Hypocritical lyes as theſe, paſſeth currant among them for ſound doctrine from their holy Father the Pope, ſo ſeared is his Conſcience as with a hot Iron: for with what Conſcience doth the Pope allow an ordinary Prieſt to abſolve for Murther, Adultery, Fornication, or perjury, but the great and hainous ſinne of eating fleſh upon a <hi>Friday</hi> or <hi>Ember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> is left to the cenſure of a plenepotentiary as being beyond the power of an ordinary Prieſt to grant abſolution for, as being a greater ſin, becauſe it is againſt the Law of the Church, then Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is, which are ſins againſt the Law of God; or with what Conſcience can the Pope make the taſting of the courſeſt fleſh,
<note place="margin">A Popiſh Lent Faſt.</note> a breach of Lent-faſt, and ſurfeiting upon the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Fiſh, to be no breach of Lent-faſt? and with what conſcience can he forbid the uſe of ſuch and ſuch meats, for the taming of the fleſh, when he allows the uſe of thoſe things which are more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the fleſh, and more provoking to fleſhly luſts; as ſtrong Wines and ſuch like? with what conſcience can he enjoyne faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for penance, and then preſently releaſe that penance for a penny? the Gloſſe upon the Canon ſaith, <hi>That he who gives a penny to redeem his penance faſt, though he give mony for a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thing; yet he doth not commit Simony, becauſe the contract is made with God:</hi> that is the excuſe, though the contract be made with the Prieſt, and the Money come to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> pocket; well did the holy Ghoſt ſay, that Antichriſt ſhould teach lies with a ſeared Conſcience; for if the Pope and Cardinals, Prelates and Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if all their conſciences were not ſeared, they would not uſe ſuch pretences to varniſh over their Hypocritical lies and errours, to damn ſo many thouſand ſouls; and thus you ſee what marks and characters the holy Ghoſt hath laid down to know the great Antichriſt and man of ſin by; which things the Parliament nor Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were never guilty of.</p>
            <p>The next Text I ſhall handle, that ſhews us who this great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is, we have in the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. to the 12. verſe; where firſt the Apoſtle earneſtly beſeecheth the <hi>Theſſalonians Church not to be ſhaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as if the day of Chriſt were at hand;</hi> here we have in this verſe ſuch a plain demonſtration of Antichriſt in his cheating, deluding &amp; couſoning practiſes as we can ſcarce find the like;
<note place="margin">What is meant by ſpirit, word and letter.</note> for by ſpirit, word and letter, I conceive the Apoſtle means all falſe ways that Antichriſt ſhall make uſe of to deceive, as falſe Teachers ſigns, lying Miracles, Inthuſiaſts: ſuch as pretend to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151652:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>have the ſpirit to work miracles, as your Prieſts that pretend to caſt out Divels, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. which transform themſelves as the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as all the <hi>Popes</hi> houlings which pretend to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Apoſtles, of which I have hinted in the former part of this book; there is no leſſe then 150 ſeveral Orders, or Degrees of them, and all pretending to holineſſe, both in Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and yet not one of them of Divine inſtitution: but are all popiſh and Antichriſtian humane inventions and inſtitutions of men? and this is one main argument that the Pope is the great Antichriſt, that he ſets up ſo many Orderers, Officers and Offices in the Church of Chriſt, againſt Chriſt; in as much that Chriſt did never inſtitute nor ordain them, and to bind mens conſciences to ſubmit to them, and other of his humane inſtitution; and that under ſuch penalties, as is ſhewed above, that he makes the breach of his own Laws, which he calls the Laws of the Church, a greater crime then the breach of the Law of God; who then can deny the <hi>Pope</hi> that thus acts to be the great Antichriſt, and all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Orders, to be the limbs and members of Antichriſt, and Seducers: who in their ſeveral places make it their whole buſineſs to keep people in obedience to this Antichriſt, their great Lord and Maſter: by their lies, and lying doctrines, and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; exalting and extolling the reliques of Saints and Martyrs, and the inſtituters of their Orders: the holineſſe and ſanctity of their habits, and the like; which things are more preached, and praiſed, and cryed up among them, then Chriſt Jeſus is preached or cried up; And to gain credit to their deluſions, they report what miraculous things have been done by the vertue of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Lethern Girdle for curing diſeaſes, and eaſing of pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Satans deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deceive</note> And indeed it is poſſible that God may ſuffer Satan by weak means to do ſome ſuch cures, which the Devil may by permiſſion be the Author and cauſe of the diſeaſe himſelf; and by his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his operation and working, the diſeaſe or paine may ceaſe: and all this to make good what the Apoſtle in this Chapter foretold ſhould come to paſſe; that becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, <hi>therefore God ſhall ſend them strong deluſions to believe lies, that all they may be damned which believe not the truth, but have pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> Another ſtory goes, that St. <hi>Katherine</hi> Girded her ſelfe, with an Iron chain ſo cloſe, that it cut her fleſh: and that ſhe uſed to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe her ſelfe three times a day with that chain an hour and an half at a time, until the blood run from her ſhoulders to her feet;

Some ſay this order began 1372.</p>
            <p>They alſo teach, that he that dies in the habit of St. <hi>Frances,</hi> ſhall not be overtaken with an untimely death: and yet Fryer <hi>Barnwell</hi> hanged himſelf in an Apple tree hard by <hi>Dublin,</hi> in St. <hi>Frances</hi> habit: ſee <hi>Paul Harris</hi> book of Friers be ſober: and they teach that he that dies in the habit of a <hi>Capouchan,</hi> he ſhall not be in Purgatory but till the fourth <hi>Saturday</hi> after his death; and the Pope hath granted the <hi>Carmalites</hi> the priviledge,
<note place="margin">The priviledge of Friers.</note> that they ſhall not be in Purgatory, but till the <hi>Saturday</hi> after their Death: it ſeems by this, that <hi>Saturday</hi> is the day of Goal delivery, and the <hi>Cardilians</hi> have priviledge granted them, to draw a ſoul out of purgatary, by ſaying five <hi>pater Noſters,</hi> and five <hi>Ave Maries;</hi> but if the Pope have this priviledge, to give this power to others, as he pretends he hath; then why doth he not draw them all out of purgatory, but ſuffer his ſervants and children to lie in a burning fire ſo many hundred years; but this is another of their Jugling Deceitful tricks to get money: for no money, no <hi>pater Noster</hi> to fetch any out of purgatory: and theſe are ſome of the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts hypocritical lies, and damnable doctrines, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they are ſuch ſpiritual men; that they can do all this I have named and much more; but the Apoſtle warns the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, that they be not removed from the truth, nor troubled in mind by ſuch ſpirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor by word, nor by letter as from us; by word,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand traditions, the Apoſtle by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, did foreſee that Antichriſt would intrude upon the Church his unwritten traditions, and urge their obſervation of them, and expect as due obedience to be given to them, as to the written
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151652:7"/>word of God; and ſo it is at this day in all the Roman Churches, the Popes Traditions is received and obſerved with as much, if not more care and diligence, as any precept of the word of God; as for example, the ſecond Commandement forbids Idols and Image worſhip; the Pope by his Traditions received from his predeceſſors, commands Image, Worſhip and Adoration, and his command is obeyed and Gods neglected; God requires that prayer ſhould be made unto him only: <hi>O,</hi> (or becauſe) <hi>thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come.

The Apoſtle fore-ſeeing this, warnes believers not to be troubled, nor turned aſide from the truth, neither by deluding ſpirits, nor by words of traditions, ſaith he, as from us; for they will pretend that they received their tradition as from us; therefore ſaith he, ver. 14. <hi>Irrethren ſtand faſt, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word or our Epiſtle:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Brethren, what traditions you have received from us by word, and what you have received in our Epiſtle, that obſerve and do: but go no further to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther traditions, but what you received from us; for if an Angel from Heaven ſhall teach you any other Goſpel, then what ye have received from us, let him be accurſed: and this Anathama excludes all unwritten Traditions, and all humane inſtitutions and inventions of men, in point of Gods Divine Worſhip, but what we have precept or example for from Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: let the Pope and his prelates, and all his followers brag as much as they will for their traditions and ceremonies: let men obſerve the Scriptures that cannot deceive, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20 to the Law &amp; to the Teſtimony, <hi>if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no truth, nor no true light in them;</hi> they either are blind and ignorant in the wayes of God, or elſe they fight againſt their own light: for we ought not to ſwerve from the written word, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, do, and the God of peace ſhall be with you:</hi> he doth not bid them follow what they ſhould hear and ſee done by the Pope, or any other that ſhould come after him; for he ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.29. <hi>That he knew after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture there would grievous Wolves enter in among them not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the flock; and that from among themſelves would men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things;</hi> which things we find true by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: and ſo again in the ſame Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.4. <hi>We have

<note place="margin">The Apoſtacy to prepare the way for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was double.</note> I take this Apoſtacy here to be meant of both theſe: forthe firſt the greateſt Hereſie, and that did the moſt hurt, was the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, which began about the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151652:9"/>year 290, and over ſpread a great part of the Chriſtian world; there was other Hereſies at that time, but this was the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Chriſtian Faith; about the year 300, when the Churches began to have ſome reſt from perſecution, and ſo from that time forward, Biſhops had ſome care of preaching; but Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, the doctrine was much defiled in many heads of it, and Reliques began to be of great account in the Church, and all kind of ſuperſtition increaſed, and pride in Biſhops: Church dignities were increaſed, and all things ſought for that might make for outward pomp and glory in the world, more then truth was ſought for; and Biſhops began to be at variance one with another, as appears by <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Epiſtle, to <hi>Miltiades</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the year 310, thus he writing, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour, unto <hi>Miltiades</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Marcus</hi> ſendeth greeting, in ſo much, as many ſuch Epiſtles are brought unto me from <hi>Alini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Livel</hi> of <hi>Africk:</hi> in which it is ſaid, that <hi>Cicelianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> is reprehended in many things, and this ſeemeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me very grievous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That among Biſhops there ſhould be ſuch diſagreeing and variance: it ſeemed good unto me, that <hi>Cecilianus</hi> himſelf, together with the Ten Biſhops that ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, and Ten other Biſhops whom he thought expedient in the behalf of this Cauſe, do ſaile into <hi>Rome,</hi> that there in the preſence of you all together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>By this it appears, here was an Apoſtacy from the primitve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even among the Biſhops, as well as by Hereticks; and this dicenſion and difference increaſed daily more and more: Biſhops ſtriving for preheminence and augmentation of their Revenues,
<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the conception of Antichriſt.</note> for honours and dignity, power and command, that the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, their example and practiſe in Government and Diſcipline, was laide aſide and forgotten, and new inventions brought into the Church, and new Titles, Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and power granted to the Biſhops, by the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was unknown and unheard of before in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; which Apoſtacy, from the Apoſtolical Goverment and diception, (if I miſtake not) was a greater advantage to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and made more way for his appearance, then all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies did; for this pride and contention, and ſtriving for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence and juriſdiction, increaſed ſtill, until the calling, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Councel of <hi>Nice:</hi> at which very time Antichriſt had his Birth and firſt bringing forth into the world; for there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his firſt authority of preheminence above other Biſhops
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151652:9"/>and Churches; he was conceived long before, and was growing in the womb of the Church; for the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>That the myſtery of iniquity did even then begin to work, onely he which now letteth, will let until he be taken out of the way;</hi> I ſhall ſhew you what it was that did let and hinder his appearance and then return to our main buſineſſe again.</p>
            <p>Now that which did lett and hinder Antichriſts appearance, until it was taken out of the way: was the Roman Heathen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Emperours, that did hinder, for Antichriſt could not ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle himſelf where he was to have his Throne, until they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: and a Chriſtian Emperour came in place, under whom he might have ſhelter in his minority, until he grew up to ſome ſtrength; which Chriſtian Emperour was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, who beſides his defending of Chriſtians from perſecution; he left <hi>Rome</hi> holy to the Pope to raign and rule in, and himſelf went to <hi>Bezantum,</hi> which now is called <hi>Conſtantible,</hi> and ſettled himſelf there.</p>
            <p>We read in <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. what fell out in the Churches upon the opening of the ſix ſeals. I muſt give you a hint concerning them, before I come to the buſineſſe I intend; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the opening of the firſt ſeal, St.</hi> John <hi>beheld a White Horſe, and he that ſate on him had a Bow, and a Crown was given unto him, and he went out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and to conquer, or that he might overcome:</hi> by this Viſion, ſome think is meant the Miniſtry of the word of God, preached by the true Worſhippers in the primitive Church next after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and their Succeſſors, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.3, 4. <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O thou moſt mighty, with thy Glory and Majesty ride on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly, becauſe of truth, and meekneſſe, and righteouſneſſe;</hi> for Chriſt did conquer wonderfully while his Ordinances was kept pure, without mixture of humane inventions and inſtitutions, and ſuperſtitious obſervations; which it may be is the cauſe why the Miniſtry doth ſo little good, and doth not work ſo effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hearers as it did in former times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And upon the opening of the ſecond ſeal, there appeared a Red Horſe, and he that ſate thereon had power given him to take peace from the Earth, and that they ſhould kill one another:</hi> by which is meant the cruel perſecutions, blood and war, that followed the preaching of the Goſpel, which is to be underſtood of the Ten perſecutions; and I think alſo what hath happened in every King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Goſpel hath prevailed, Antichriſt and his inſtruments hath raiſed war and perſecution and ſowed ſedition,

            <p>
               <hi>And upon the opening of the third ſeale, there appeared a Black Horſe, and he that ſate upon him had ballance in his hand:</hi> by which is ſignified ſamine and ſcarcity of Food, which for the moſt part doth follow wars; for the contempt of the Goſpel brings wars, and wars brings famine; and it is recorded that about the year 316 there was a grievous Famine <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Now Joſealil</hi> to the Reader, whether here began not all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery where they thought to end it: ſo great difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ways of God and the ways of men, for here at this time was the very firſt birth of Antichriſt, the Biſhop and Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Primate and Metrapolitan of the firſt See: this was his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for the Biſhops before the council, by their contentions and the Biſhops in the council, both falling away and departing from the ſincerity of the Goſpel, and from the inſtitutions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and making new officers and orders in the Church, with new titles of Primacy and Metrapolitans, and <hi>Dioceſans,</hi> with a number more that depend upon them, as is ſhewed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151652:12"/>part of his book, one hundred and fifty by name,
<note place="margin">Here was the birth of Anrichriſt.</note> of ſeverall Titles and Religious Orders now in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and not one of them of Jeſus Chriſt nor his Apoſtles inſtitution, but all of humans invention, without any preſident, precept or example, or any Text in the New Teſtament to ground them upon: the original and chief Titles of all, was deviſed and decreed in this council for making the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> Primate and Metrapolitan of the firſt fear; from this Title and Juriſdiction then given him, he took occaſion thereby from that very time, to advance himſelf, and to claim authority over all other Churches, and as I ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Antichriſt, had his conception long before; for <hi>Rome</hi> being the chief City of the Empire, and above all other Cities; ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> thought to be above all other Biſhops; and the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>That the mystery of iniquity did even then begin to work in his time:</hi> Antichriſt had this conception then, and he grew biger and biger in the womb of the Church, until this Council ſate: and then this Council was as the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to his birth to bring him forth, and ſo by the power he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by that decree, he was nurſed up and grew ſtronger and ſtronger, until the year 606, and then he came to the full ſtrength of a man or rather a Beaſt, for ſo the Scriptures terms him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>And the man of ſin,</hi> 3 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4 For then he obtained the Title of univerſal Biſhop, and after in the year 684. he obtained to be called Chriſts Vicar; ſo that now he was armed with Titles, and Authority, to make him the complear Antichriſt, to act againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: ſo as never none before him nor ſince, did nor could do: for none had the like Authority, Power and Preheminence, as this Council of <hi>Nice</hi> gave unto him, and that by their falling away and departing from the Apoſtolical inſtitutions, and Goſpel puriey; ſo that from the time of this Council, every age grew more corrupt then the former, as ſhall appear in ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Whereas in the firſt Primitive Church, according to the appoſtolical inſtitutions, Biſhops, or Paſtors and other Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Churches, they were elected and choſen by the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Church or Churches, to whom they were to officiate; for we ſee the Apoſtles themſelves, even when they were altogether in Council; &amp; had more authority then ever any man or council had ſince, yet durſt not they, as <hi>Arelatenſes</hi> ſaid in the council of <hi>Baſill,</hi> they durſt not, nor would not take the power that belonged to the believing <hi>Church</hi> from them, no, not to appoint inferiour officers

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As the Biſhops, and after the council were fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Apoſtical inſtitution, as to the election of Inferiour Officers of the <hi>Church:</hi> ſo alſo they were fallen away from the order of electing of Biſhops or Paſtors of the <hi>Church;</hi> you ſhall ſee this in <hi>Acts</hi> the firſt, when they were to chuſe one in <hi>Judas</hi> place, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. <hi>In thoſe dayes</hi> Peter <hi>ſtood up in the middeſt of the diſciples, and ſaid (the number of the names were about an hundred and twenty) men and brethren;</hi> this Scripture muſt needs have been fulfilled, which the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of <hi>David</hi> ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> which was guide to them that took Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherefore of theſe men that have accompanied with us all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out amongſt us, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> unto the ſame day that he was taken up from us, muſt one be ordained to be a witneſſe with us of his reſurrection: and they appointed two, that is I conceive 120 of the Church, as they did the Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. The <hi>Church</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and appointed two <hi>Joſephs,</hi> called <hi>Barſabas,</hi> who was ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Juſtas and Matthias:</hi> and they prayed, that is, the Apoſtles and the 120, and ſaid, <hi>Thou Lord which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen, that he may take part with this Miniſtry and Apoſtleſhip: and they gave forth their Lots,

<note place="margin">Election and Lots would end all ſtrife.</note> that God who knows the hearts of all men, may make his choice, which he in his wiſdome knows is moſt fit for that office; for the Lot is caſt into the Lap, but the whole diſpoſing thereof is from the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33.

            <p>And thirdly, they fall away from the Apoſtolical inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, of electing members to ſit in council: for though it belong to the Supreme Magiſtrate, to call a council or S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nod, and to order the time and place for their meeting and ſitting; ye I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151652:14"/>have not found in all that I have read in my life, that either this council of <hi>Nice,</hi> or any other council or Synod ſince, that the members that ſate were elected and choſen according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel order and inſtitution; ſo that it ſeems, the falling away of the Biſhops by their pride and covetouſneſſe, mallice and envy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſtrife, which occaſioned the calling of this councell, together with the falling away of the councel, by their acting and decreeing ſo contrary to the Apoſtles inſtitutions, as is ſaid above; and alſo the members ſitting in Councel, not being elected to ſit, according to the Apoſtles example in the like caſe, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the firſt primitive Church; who can deny but this was the greateſt falling away that ever hath been ſince the Apoſtles days unto this day? conſidering as we ſhall hear after the things that followed after, and doth ſtill continue occaſioned by this their falling away.</p>
            <p>And that the Members of this Councel, nor of any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel or Synod ſince, as farre as I can learne, was not elected nor choſen according to the inſtitutions and example of the Apoſtles; and firſt Primitive Churches, it will appear very plain from, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. that the believing Church, as is ſhewed above by the Apoſtles order, had their votes in electing and chuſing, Firſt, Of Biſhops, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. Secondly, Of Inferiour Church-officers, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. Thirdly, Of Members to ſit in Councel, as here <hi>Acts</hi> 15. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who I dare ſay had as much Authority and more, and more lawfully called to their Authority, then any Pope and Prelate in the world;
<note place="margin">Members of Synod ought to be elected.</note> yet durſt not they when the difference fell out in the Church of <hi>Anteoch,</hi> about which they had no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; go to the Councel about that queſtion, without a lawful call, until they were lawfully elected, and choſen by the believers, the Church of <hi>Antioch:</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>They determined</hi> (that is, the Church determined) <hi>to ſend</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and certain other of the brethren, to go up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>unto the Apoſtles and Elders;</hi> Mark here, the Elders ſate in Councel with the Apoſtles about this queſtion, which was ſuch another queſtion as was diſputed in the Councel of <hi>Nice;</hi> but neither <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Barnabas,</hi> nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members of the Church would offer to go, until they were elected, and appointed by the Church to go; <hi>and when they came to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they were received of the Church, and of the Apoſtles and Elders:</hi> where you ſee the Apoſtles and Elders are not here called the Church, as ſome do vainly think, that the Apoſtles and Elders are the Church; they indeed are members of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:151652:14"/>but not the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf: for here the Church is ſpoken of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly from the Apoſtles and Elders; they were received of the Church, that is, of the Congregation or body of believers, and of the Apoſtles and Elders; and thus our Nineteenth Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> diſcribes the viſible Church of Chriſt to be a Congregation of faithful men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I have diſcourſed more largely of this in the former part of this book, and therefore will ſay no more here.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be doubted, but theſe brethren of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> though Laymen that were elected by the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> to go with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the councel at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but they were permitted to ſit in councel with the Apoſtles and Elders; that, as well as to acquaint the councel with the ſtate of the Church, that had elected and ſent them: ſo alſo that their vote and conſcience might go along in the determination; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this, <hi>Arelatenſes</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Lodovicus</hi> and <hi>Paenorme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Baſill,</hi> ſaith, that the dignity of Fathers is not to be reſpected in the Council, but onely reaſon, nor any thing more to be looked after then Truth; neither, ſaith he, will I prefer a lye of a Biſhop, though he be never ſo great, before the Truth of a poor Prieſt: neither ought a Biſhop to diſdaine, if a man be unlearned, for wiſdome dwelleth oftner under a bare and ragged cloak, then in rich Ornaments and Apparel; wherefore, ſaith he, I pray you my Lord Biſhops do not ſo much contemne your Inferiours; for the firſt that dyed for Chriſt; and opened the way of Martyrdome, was no Biſhop but a Levite; but if we repeat the example of old Councels, we ſhall find that the inferiours were always preſent with the Biſhops in Councels: and what is more comely ſaith he, for us to follow, then the doctrines and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Apoſtles; as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to us:</hi> that is, the Apoſtles and Elders with the Church, and the word it ſeemed good, ſignifieth in this place, not only conſultation, but deciſion and determination; whereby it appears that others beſides Apoſtles or Biſhops had determinating voyces in Councels; and in another place ſaith, that is <hi>Acts</hi> the 6. which is ſpoken to above, ſaith he, when the Apoſtles would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of any weighty matter,
<note place="margin">Lay-men a Miniſters ought to in Counce with Biſh</note> they durſt not determine by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but <hi>the twelve called together the multitude.</hi> And ſeeing all things were written for our learning, it ſeem the Apoſtles would give us example that in ſuch weighty matters we ſhould admit our inferiours, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> who then was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151652:15"/>but a Prieſt, yet he did manfully withſtand the Arrians. Alſo in the Councel of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> which was counted one of the four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Councels, there was preſent four hundred Prieſts, and we have moſt evident teſtimony for inferiours in Councels; for the chiefe and principal of all the divines St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith upon theſe words, where Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter, I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> he ſaith, by theſe words judiciall power was given not only to <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo to the other Apoſtles, and alſo to the whole Church, Biſhops and Prieſts. If therefore Prieſts have a judicial power in the Church, what ſhould let but that they alſo may have determinate voyces in the Councels and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods; and ſaith he, if Abbots who were not inſtituted by Chriſt, have their determinate voices in Councels, as they alwaies have, why ſhould not Prieſts have the ſame? mark here the Councel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that Abbots are not of Chriſts inſtitution: ſee for this, the Acts and monuments of the Primitive Church <hi>page</hi> 624.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what the practiſe of the Apoſtles was, and their admiting of Miniſters and Lay-men that were godly and lawfully elected into their councels; and which was alſo practiſed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient councels, though ſince this councel of <hi>Nice;</hi> I do not read that Lay-men have been admitted, though hear in this councel of <hi>Baſill,</hi> God ſtirred up this man to contend for the truth: but the occaſion of this diſpute in the councel of <hi>Baſill,</hi> was not about Lay-men, but the Biſhops would have had Prieſts and Deacons, and all excluded from having a determining Vote, but onely Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and I think they have had it ſo ever ſince, both in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Synods: except it were ſome of their own creatures, that would ſay as they ſay; but as to the due election of members to be in the councels, according to the Apoſtolical inſtitution that hath been altogether neglected this 1300 years, ſince the councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> through the pride and preſumption of Biſhops, and the prevalence of Antichriſt then brought forth by that councel: which practiſe you ſee is contrary to the Apoſtles inſtitution and example, and is alſo contrary even to reaſon, and to the practiſe of Kingdoms in civil affairs; as Parliaments that give and make Laws for the Government of the Kingdome in civil affairs, they are elected and choſen by the countrey, ſo that what Lawes they make as to the Government of the outward man, they are bound to ſtand to and obey, for it is their own act; they elected and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted them to make ſuch Laws as ſhould be for their wealth and ſafety.</p>
            <p>And can any man be ſo bruitiſh, as to think that believers, who
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151652:15"/>are the miſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt, and who alone are the Church in Scripture ſenſe: &amp; can any man think that <hi>Christ</hi> would have them excluded from medling with the affairs of the Church, which particularly belongs unto them, and which Church they are: is there not as much reaſon, that they ſhould have their Vote in electing them, that are to ſit in councels, or Synods, to make Laws to bind their conſcience, as to have a vote in electing thoſe in Parliament, that make Laws to bind the outward man: and are not theſe examples and practiſes of the Apoſtles and firſt primitive Church, in theſe three ſeveral points ſpoken to above, as ſure and ſafe rules to walk by, as can be ſhewed for any other aſſembly or meetings to make Laws by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For can it be thought that Jeſus Chriſt would appoint for ſuch a work, Necromancers, Witches, Conjurers, Sorcerers, Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Simoniacks, Sodomites, abuſers of themſelves with mankind, inceſteous perſons, and covetous Idolaters; Lyers, Swearers,
<note place="margin">Judge if theſe be ſit to make Laws for the Church of Chriſt.</note> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both-breakers, Murtherers. Per jured perſons, full of Wrath and Strife, Mallice and Envy, Sedition and Hereſie, Adulterers, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, Drunkards, abounding in all the works of the fleſh, as a great part both of Popes and Prelates have been and are: that theſe and ſuch like ſhould give Lawes to his Church and Spouſe, that their acts and determinations ſhould be reputed and taken for the acts and determinations of the Church; who are not, as I have proved in the former part of this Book, ſo much as true members of any particular rightly conſtituted Church of Jeſus Chriſt in Scripture ſence themſelves, and who never had a right call to their office, nor to ſit in councel, nor Synod, according to the Scripture order as is ſhewed above: they came not in at the door, but at the window like thieves and robbers: that theſe ſhould make Laws for Chriſts Spouſe, to bind their conſciences to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and Idolatrous Obſervations, and will-worſhip contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and againſt the written word of God; and by their magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent outward power and authority to compel men to obedience againſt their conſcience, and reſtraine them from worſhipping God according to his own inſtitutions. Beloved, ſuch wayes and doings as theſe are not of God: conſider it in time, and lay it to heart, for the Lord is a God of Judgement, by him actions are weighed; and thus all theſe things ſaid together, and juſtly weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, it will appear, that this Apoſtacy and falling away of the Biſhops, before the councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of the Biſhops in the councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> to be the greateſt Apoſtacy and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151652:16"/>falling away from the inſtitutions and example of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and of the longeſt continuance that ever was in the world, this 1660 years: for it is of 1300 years continuance, and the greateſt evil and miſchief it hath produced to the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt; for the <hi>Arian</hi> Herefie, is gone, and other Herefies are gone, but the effects of this falling away continues ſtill.</p>
            <p>O ye Chriſtian Princes,

            <p>But yet a word or two more, to ſhew how great this Apoſtacy and falling away of the Biſhops was, before the councel of <hi>Nice.

And this was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> which falling away of the Biſhops appears further by the Teſtimony of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour; for beſides his Epiſtles I have already ſpoken of, which ſhews, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151652:16"/>the Biſhops contentions was the cauſe of calling the councel of <hi>Nice;</hi> and the next day after the councel met the Emperour in the councel made an Oration, and exhorted them to concord and agreement: and to remove from their minds all private malice and grildge, which they had one towards another; for divers of them had accuſed one another, and the day before had put up Libels to the Emperour againſt one another. See <hi>Socrates</hi> firſt, book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. See alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. At another councel at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> where thus he writes; <hi>Verily I know not what matters Aſſembly through Tumult and Troubleſome ſtirre hath decreed;</hi> Methinks the truth it ſelfe, you have in a manner ſubverted,
<note place="margin">The Apoſtacy of the Biſhop a very great Apoſtacy.</note> by means of your Hurle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly, and kindled heat of contention; for you proſecute your private ſpite and hatred one towards another, and ſeem to neglect the ſervice of God, and furtherance of truth; and after he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that ſeeme to maintaine the holy Miſteries of Chriſts <hi>Church,</hi> that they do practiſe nothing elſe but that which breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſcord and diſcention; to be ſhort, that which tendeth to the utter overthrow and deſtruction of mankind, by all which it doth manifeſtly appear, that this Apoſtacy and falling of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and the councel, was a very exceeding great falling away from the Apoſtles inſtitutions and example; and moſt like of any to be that very falling away that the Apoſtle ſpake of, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>With the which the great Antichriſt and man of ſin ſhould be uſhered in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is manifeſt, all the evil and miſery that hath befallen the Chriſtian Churches ever ſince, by the prevalency of the Pope, the great Antichriſt: came in by the falling away of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What evil the Decree of <hi>Nice</hi> producued.</note> and by the falling away of the <hi>Councell;</hi> for that decree of Lord Primats, Metrapolytans, and Lord Dioceſans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and giving them ſuch large Juriſdiction and Authority over others, their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals; though they might pretend that theſe ſhould ſit as in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny watch towers, to overſee the reſt, and to keep out Hereſie and Schiſme; but how fair a pretence ſoever they, or any elſe can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to excuſe their doings: it may teach us how dangerous a thing it is, to ſtep aſide out of Gods way, for their decree being a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtituion, and a falling away from the inſtitutions of the Apoſtles, as you heard above; the event that it produced, was not only the bringing in of Antichriſt, but a multitude of Hereſies more, and the increaſing of thoſe Hereſies that then was. I think you may eaſily read the ſin in the puniſhment, as you ſhall hear anone; for <hi>Euſebius, Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Necomedia,</hi> and <hi>Theognis Biſhop</hi> of

               <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Marris Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Calcedone,</hi> &amp;c. all <hi>Arian Biſhops;</hi> they alſo were enabled and authorized by this decree of this councel, with ſuch power and juriſdiction in their Provinces, over inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Biſhops <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they compelled the other <hi>Biſhops</hi> to ſide with them, or elſe they caſt them out: that in ſhort time this Hereſie overſpread a great part of the Chriſtian World; for they called Synods and councels in their own juriſdictions, and condemned, and excommunicated the Orthodox Biſhops and Paſtors; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party again condemned and excommunicated them, ſo that theſe councels and Synods, curſed and excommunicated one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as I have ſhewed in the former part of this book, of above Twenty councels, that curſed and excommunicated one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was a great ſtickler in the <hi>Nicen</hi> councel, in making that decree; he felt the effect of what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, for he was five or ſix times baniſhed into Exile, and forced by Hereticks to fly for to ſave his life; and thus perſecution began again, for many tumults and bickrings there was and great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made, and cruel Tortors and Torments deviſed and executed upon ſuch as would not be of their ſide; ſo that the perſecutions is ſaid by ſome, to be as cruel as the former, only it had changed the name; for the former perſecutions was by Heathens, and this was by pretended Chriſtians; thus it appears in part what miſery that decree and falling away from the Goſpell inſtitutions did bring forth: for it furniſhed the Pope with authority to make him the Antichriſt: he took occaſion from theſe broyls and diſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to hear and determine cauſes of both ſides, whereby he ever after clamed a Supremacy over all other <hi>Churches,</hi> and at laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it; that decree alſo furniſhed and inabled <hi>Arians, Maſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, Noviſians</hi> and other Hereticks to work their feats, ſo that ſoon after this councel had made that decree Hereſies never came in to the <hi>Ghurch</hi> half ſo faſt, neither before nor ſince, as at that time, for the ſpace of 30 years. For Pope <hi>Liberus,</hi> about the year 352 was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and Pope <hi>Felix,</hi> about 358, was alſo an <hi>Arian,</hi> ſo that this falling away of the Biſhops and councel was exceeding great, and hath produced ſo many new inventions in Religion, and ſo many ceremonies; and that is another part of their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the examples of the Apoſtles. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. Their care was to aboliſh ceremonies, and lay no heavier burthen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them but neceſſary things; but the Pope and Prelates hath burthened the Church with unneceſſary ceremonies; and with above 150 Religious Orders, that not one of them is of Divine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151652:17"/>inſtitution, to all which this Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> in that decree laid the foundation.</p>
            <p>But this was not all that followed upon that new decree and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inſtitution:
<note place="margin">Biſhops Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority cannot keep out He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</note> for immediately followed a number of Hereſies more, which that decree made way for: that every Biſhop in his own Province might make what Lawes he pleaſed.

<note place="margin">The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that befel the Church after the decree of Nice.</note> that however the Councel and others ſince may pretend that theſe new Officers and Offices invented by them of Pope and Lord Primate, and Lord Metrapolitan, and Lord Dioceaſan <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with their large Juriſdiction and Authority given them: with preheminency of priority &amp; ſuperiority, was the way to keep out Hereſie: yet that God might let both them and us ſee how dangerous it is to leave his divine inſtitutions, and imbrace or deviſe novelties in any part of his Worſhip or Service, though upon never ſo faire pretences; how ſuddenly after did all theſe Hereſies ariſe in the Church, to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151652:18"/>let them ſee both their ſinfulneſſe and fooliſhneſſe, in forſaking the inſtitutions and rules laid down in the Scriptures for us to walk by; the forſaking whereof, with what it produced, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to this day, may convince us both of the ſin, and ſhew us the puniſhment; and it is not to be paſt over without taking notice of: that the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> where firſt this wicked decree was made, it was the very firſt City that was given up into the hand of the <hi>Oramen</hi> Family (which now we call <hi>Turks.</hi>) as a puniſhment upon the very place, as we have ground to think.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Nicen</hi> Councel, Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, did ſit under the blowing of the ſecond Trumpet; the effect of which is, that a great mountain burning with Fire was caſt into the Sea, and the third part of the Sea became blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Sea, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Doctrine of the Goſpel in it's purity: and by a third part becoming blood, is meant, the mingling of Prince-hood, and Lord Primacy, with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and inſtitutions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: which was done by this Councel, as you have heard above: that through the pride of Biſhops ſtriving for dignities, they were embroiled in bloody wars and Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note place="margin">Mingling Doctrines of men with the Goſpel.</note> as then it came to paſſe; and by Mountaines, is meant in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Princes, and Peers, and Great Men, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.12.14. <hi>The day of the Lord of hoſt is upon all that are proud and haughty, and upon all the high Mountains, and upon the Halls that are lifted up:</hi> and which may well be applyed to the pride of Popes and Prelates: and by the 3d part of the creatures in the Sea dying; if by the Sea we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand with <hi>Brightman</hi> the Doctrine of the Goſpel, then by the 3d part dying in the Sea, we may underſtand, the deſtruction of the multitude that have received the doctrine of that humane decree of <hi>Nice,</hi> and mingled it with the pure doctrine of the Goſpel, and the doctrines of the Popes and Prelates, and all the rabble of Monks and Fryers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that mingle their inventions of doctrine and diſcipline, ceremonies and the like, with the inſtitutions of the Goſpel, of which a third part died.</p>
            <p>So inſatiable they were of honour, and to have preheminency, that in the next age following, that, three moſt holy Popes, who no doubt could not erre; which was <hi>Zozimus, Boniface,</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine;</hi> yet were all three convicted of Forgery, for falcefying the Act; of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councel, to exable their Principality, though the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Nice</hi> had given them more before, then Chriſt had left them; but what authority the Councel had given them, they laboured to improve, and did, until they accompliſht their deſire to have a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151652:18"/>univerſal power over all Churches; and this made them the great Antichriſt and man of ſin, other wiſe he could not have been Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; for it was foretold of him, that he ſhould exalt himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that was called Gods, that is, above all Magiſtrates and Officers who are called God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the Councel of <hi>Carthage</hi> writ to <hi>Celestine,</hi> and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him, not to commit ſuch a ſin, as to bring in the Smoke and and Swelling pride of the world, of Antichriſt they might have ſaid, into the Church of Chriſt; and thus in time their impudence grew up to its height: you may ſee from hence, how dangerous it is to bring innovations into the Church of Chriſt to mingle mens inſtitutions, with Gods inſtitutions; to make and inſtitute Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Offices in the Church, which Chriſt ordained not, nor will not own, but will ſay unto them, <hi>Get ye behind me, or depart ye curſed I know ye not;</hi> by theſe Lordly Titles and Juriſdictions that you have exerciſed, I ordained them not; for will any man fearing God, that is in his right wits, think that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who had an immediate call from Chriſt to their office, and were endowed with an infallible and unerring ſpirit that they did not know better then any Pope or Prelate, councel or other, what Officers and order was beſt for the Church: but that men dare preſume to reject and neglect Chriſts order and inſtitutions, and make orders and inſtitutions of their own; it is good to draw neer to God, but it is dangerous to go from him, and run out of his way that he hath preſcribed for us to walk in; it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. <hi>That Christ holdeth the ſtars in his right hand:</hi> by ſtars is meant the Paſtors of the Church, which while they walk in Gods way, Chriſt holds them in his right hand, to keep and direct them: as it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall keep thee in all thy wayes:</hi> and he is a powerfull keeper, and a faithful maintainer of all his faithful ſervants; but thoſe that walk out of Gods way, have no promiſe of protection in ſuch curſed crooked ways.</p>
            <p>Thus having hitherto ſet down the manner of the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts appearance, how he came to his Throne by the removing of the Heathen Emperours, which was it that hindred, until it was taken out of the way: and alſo of the falling away of the Biſhops before the councel, and of the Biſhops in the councel of <hi>Nice:</hi> how both fell away from the inſtitutions and example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the firſt primitive purity, both as to the election of Biſhops, and other Church Officers, and as to the election of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert to ſit in councels: all which rules is laid down in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151652:19"/>for us to walk by, which the Biſhops and councel; not only fell from, but they made new inſtitutions and canons of their own without, and contrary to the Scripture, which was both as Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife and Nurſe, to bring forth and Nurſe up Antichriſt, to his full ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now I come to ſpeak of the thing, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould do after he is come; and the Apoſtle ſaith; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>That he ſhould oppoſe and exalt himſelf above all that is called God,

            <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> interpreteth Antichriſts ſacrilegious pride, to be a kind of immoderate power over all Religion; for thus he ſaith; <hi>Autichriſt ſhall war againſt the Saints, and overcome them, and ſhall be puffed up with ſo great pride, as he ſhall attempt to change Gods Laws and Ceremonies, ſubjecting all Religion to his own will;</hi> In which he points out the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to the life to be the great Antichriſt, for that humane Authority the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> gave him, he hath improved: that in the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and ſo far as the Popes power extends, the Laws of God are almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and new inſtituted Orders, Officers, and Diſcipline is eſtabliſhed, and almoſt all things is become new, as is ſhewed in the former part of this book, yea 150 new Religious orders, and not one of them of Chriſts inſtitution, and many more things the like; ſo that by the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Heirome,</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be the great Antichriſt and man of ſin, and ſon of perdition, that exalts and oppoſeth all that is called, God, that is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. all earthly Magiſtrates; <hi>I ſaid ye are gods, but ye ſhall die like men,</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151652:21"/>falling from Heaven to Earth,</hi> is meant, ſome eminent perſon in the Church, falling from heavenly things to earthly things; which ſome think, is meant of, ſome Maſter of an Hereſie: but <hi>Joachimus Abbas</hi> thinks it to be ſome Clergy-man, and both is true, and may eaſily be found in one man: namely, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the great Antichriſt, for he is both a Clergy-man and a Maſter of Hereſie, yea, and of more Hereſies then ever one man was Maſter of. For as I have proved in the firſt part, the preſent Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of above forty ſeveral Hereſies: and this Star falling from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to earth, cannot ſo fitly be compared to any man upon the earth, as to the Pope; for this Trumpet is thought to blow about the year 607. at which time Pope <hi>Boneface</hi> the Third, obtained of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> the Traytor and Murthering Emperour who murthered his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, granted the Pope to be called univerſal Biſhop: to get the Popes favour to help to uphold him in his uſurped Throne of Murther; and he again as a requiral, confers upon the Pope this uſurped and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Title of univerſal Biſhop over all other Churches; other prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Popes had been ſtriving long to obtain that dignity of univerſal Biſhop but could not obtain it till now: alſo <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> ſought for it: upon which account, <hi>Gregory</hi> the great did write in his Fourth book, Epiſtle the 34. <hi>By this pride,</hi> ſaith he <hi>what thing elſe is ſignified but that Antichriſt is at hand;</hi> and again, in the ſame book ſaith he, <hi>The King of pride</hi> (meaning An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And as to their miracles I have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before, and therefore will not relate it here again; only this I will ſay, that ſuppoſe theſe miracles they tell us of were true, as they are not probable they ſhould be; yet we read that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> magicians by permiſſion and by the help and aſſiſtance of the Devil, did work as great miracles as they, and the Divel both hath done, and will do the like among them for their deluſion,

Some think, that by the two Horns of this Beaſt is meant, the Popes Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power which he exerciſeth, and pretends his Juriſdiction from the Lamb Jeſus Chriſt; for ſaith he, in the decretals it is not to be thought, that this my Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been preferred by any general Councel, but obtained the primacy only by the voice of the Goſpel and the mouth of the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; but take notice, that it is the Popiſh Goſpel of unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions is there to be underſtood; for there is not a word in all the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, that gives the Pope his primacy: alſo Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever underſtandeth not the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my Prieſthood, let him look up to the Firmament, where he may ſee two great lights, the Sun and Moon, one to rule the day, the other to rule the night:</hi> ſo in the Firmament of the univerſal Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our dignity is ſo much the weightier, as we have the greater charge to give account to God for the Lawes of men, as well as for the Laws of the Church: whereby it is manifeſt that the pope doth exerciſe both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction: Mr. <hi>Dent</hi> ſaith, <hi>That by the firſt Feaſt that roſe out of the Sea,</hi> ſpoken of in the firſt verſe of this Chapter, is meant, <hi>The Heathen Roman Empire:</hi> but I conceive not that to be the meaning, <hi>For that Beast is ſaid to have ſeven Heads and ten Horns,</hi> and the Heathen Roman Empire was but the Sixth Head; for when <hi>John</hi> writ the <hi>Revelation,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Five of the Heads were fallen,</hi> that is, the five ſeveral Governments that had been in <hi>Rome</hi> from the time that it was built until that time was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, which chief or head Governments called the heads of the

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151652:33"/>was about 87 years, which was but a ſhort ſpace in compariſon of the time that he hath raigned ſince his wound was healed; but <hi>Rome</hi> was taken again after this by <hi>Adulphus,</hi> who gave it ſuch a deadly blow, that he began to adviſe with himſelf about changing the name thereof, and to call it <hi>Gothia.

Now my good Lord Biſhop, I think I have ſhewed you ſeveral Texts that Propheſied of Antichriſt, which was never fulfilled by the Long parliament, nor Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor cannot properly be applyed unto them.</p>
               <p>But this deadly wound was healed, after the ſpace of 132 years, about the year 547. in <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour his time, by means of the Proweſſe and Valour of <hi>Belliſarius</hi> and <hi>Narſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The beaſts wound was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in 547.</note> the <hi>Gothes</hi> were never ſo ſhattered; the Emperour played the Phiſitians part in good earneſt, for he firſt took away bad humours, by repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Barbarians, and utterly deſtroying them: and then he powred in Wine and Oyle; for that decree in the Novel conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> being 131 in number, was inſtead of a ſoft healing plaiſter: we decree according to the decrees of holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, that the moſt holy Biſhop of old <hi>Rome</hi> is the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of all the Prieſts; how greatly was the wound healed up by this decree that ſeemed to be a deadly wound? ſaith Mr. <hi>Brightman.</hi>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:151652:33"/>Thus it doth evidently appear, that the Beaſt that had the wound of a Sword and did live, is the Pope, the great Anti-Chriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom it is ſaid in the 15. verſe of this 13. Chapter, that it was permitted unto him to give a ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Image of the Beaſt, ſo that the Image of the Beaſt ſhould ſpeak: after this beaſts deadly wound was healed, men began to adore this Beaſt like an Idol, his affliction did not reform him, but he returned to the Idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of his Predeceſſors; ſo that his Idolatry was a lively Image of the Idolatry both of former Popes, and of the Heathen Emperors Idolatry; and he cauſed them that dwelt on the earth to make the Image of the Beaſt; that is, to commit the ſame Idolatry: and it was permitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to give a ſpirit to the Image of the Beaſt, that it ſhould ſpeak; that is, it is made to ſpeak by the whole Crew of the Popiſh Clergie, crying up the Antiquity of the Roman Church, of their Doctrine and Ceremonies and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as received from the Apoſtles, though the Apoſtles were ſtrangers to ſuch things, and knew nothing of them: but it would avail the Pope but little to erect ſuch an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way of Idolatrous worſhip, with ſo many Ceremonies, and vain humane Inventions. If it were not for his Clergy his Locuſts and Frogs that are in ſuch multitudes in every Countrey, that puts life in this Idol or Image by their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible threatnings, and Excommunications againſt all that ſhall dare to mutter any thing againſt their holy Father, the Popes proceedings, affirming him to be the univerſal Biſhop, Chriſts Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, and that he cannot erre, &amp; therefore his Decrees, Cannons, Injunctions and conſtitutions are to be received and obeyed as divine Oracles, upon pain of damnation; ſo that he deceives (ſaith verſe the 14.) them that dwell on the earth, and cauſeth that thoſe that will not worſhip this Image ſhould be killed, as many thouſands have been for denying that Idolatrous worſhip: thus theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments with their threatnings and deluſions, put life into their Image-worſhiping, and all other their Idolatries.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151652:40"/>Popes, who doth exerciſe both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power and juriſdiction, and ſo is the eighth, and yet one of the ſeven, becauſe of his double authority: the Angel ſpeaking of theſe ſeven Heads, that five were fallen before <hi>John</hi> writ, and one is, which was the government of the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that was the fixth; he doth not ſay, and the ſeventh is not yet come; for that might have implyed, that the ſeventh ſhould have been a Civil Head only, as the other ſix were; but he ſaith, <hi>and the other</hi> (or another) <hi>is not yet come;</hi> implying, that he ſhould be another of a divers nature, differing from all the former Kings, for they only were Civil Governors, but this ſeventh ſhould be of a mixt kinde, he ſhould be both a Civil and an Eccleſiaſtical Governor, in reſpect of which Eccleſiaſtical Government he is ſaid to be the eighth, and one of the ſeven, as the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Governments are both included in one perſon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtian Emperors cannot be underſtood to be the ſeventh head becauſe their Government is only Civil; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot properly be ſaid to be the eighth, and one of the ſeven: neither had they their ſeat at <hi>Rome</hi> the ſeven hilled Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where the former ſix Governed: from all theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that I have touched upon, and opened in a ſlender man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet as well as I can; I think it will evidently appear to the impartial Reader, that the ſucceſſion of Popes is the Beaſt and great Antichriſt, and Man of ſin, and Son of perdition, <hi>that exalts himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> &amp;c. and is the great Antichriſt that was to come into the world: much more might be ſaid, but I haſten to another buſineſs.</p>

            <p>IN the 6 firſt pages of his Book, he endeavours to poſſeſs the Reader that the perſecution in theſe late daies of the Long Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did exceed in cruelty the perſecutions in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, and do confeſs, that in reference to his Majeſty, both King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, and King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſcond, it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151652:41"/>did exceed the former; for King <hi>Henry</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> were not perſecuted, but they were the chief cauſers of the perſecutions: but what he ſaith to the perſecution of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I think moderate men that are not overſway'd with prejudicate opinions, they will ſay that the perſecutions that was in theſe late daies, was much inferiour to that in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> daies: when the Biſhop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Farrar</hi> of Saint <hi>Davids,</hi> all five Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were burned to aſhes; alſo long time after their death, the bones of <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Phagius</hi> were taken out of their Graves and burnt, and the body of <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> Wife taken out of her grave and baryed in a dunghil, by Cardinal <hi>Poules</hi> order, the year One thouſand five hundred fifty ſeven, bloudy <hi>Bonner</hi> himſelf in three years condemned three hundred Chriſtians to the fire; what was there then in all parts of the Kingdom, it would amount to ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: did ever any man before you, except he were a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, ſay as you affirm in your fourth page, that theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and other Martyrs in King <hi>Henry</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> daies, were uſed after a far better manner, and were more juſtly proceeded againſt, and more fairly handled, and leſs cruelly dealt with, than others were by the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe, it is true, plundered and caſt out of part of their eſtates; but the others ſuffered flames of fire, and their whole eſtates confiſcate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> miſtake me not, I come not in the leaſt to excuſe them, for it is granted they were too cruel; but my aim is, if you will not be made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of your own miſtakes, yet to endeavour to make others ſenſible of it; becauſe I would not have all, nor any thing that you have written in excuſe of the Pope, the great enemy of God and of his Church, to be believed; for if you had not excuſed the Pope, I had held my peace, and ſhould not have troubled my ſelf nor others.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh and eight pages, he ſaith that the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faction of the Long Parliament, did move him to ſettle his thoughts to ſearch the Scriptures that foretold of the coming of the great Antichriſt, and to pray moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly night and day for the help of Gods grace and Spirit to guide him in the true underſtanding thereof, and by reading the beſt Authors to help him in the ſame.</p>

               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:151652:41"/>I anſwer, I will not ſay much of what force his prayers might be, but the Tree is known by the fruit, and when men obtain the thing prayed for or ſomthing equivolent to it, they have ground of comfort that their prayers are heard; but as I ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſom men are like <hi>Iohanan, &amp;c.</hi> 42. of <hi>Ier.</hi> that reſolv be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand that thus and thus they will do, and then they go and pray, though they intend not to alter their Reſolution: for, though he prayed to underſtand the meaning of ſuch Texts, by reaping the beſt Authors, yet in his 24th. page he ſays Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hamond,</hi> the <hi>Magdeburgenſes, Calvin, Beza</hi> and in another place the Author of the <hi>Revelation</hi> unrevealed, and ſaith, he found many good and probable arguments produced by them, and <hi>Luther, Iuneus, Chytreus, Tilenus, Moureſius, Powel, Whitaker, Tomſon, Brightman, Downham,</hi> and many others, whom he ſaith do unanimouſly affirm, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5 that Text myſterie, that great <hi>Babilon,</hi> the mother of Whoredom and Abomination of the earth, is the ſame with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13. the Church that is at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and is interpreted-by the Ancient Fathers to ſignifie <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Papius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, Tertullius, Adverſus, Iudeus,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom, Auguſtin,</hi> and divers others of late Writers. Here you ſee the names of above twenty Authors, and ſaith them and divers others beſides, that he hath read, and finds many probable arguments from them all, and prays that by reading of Authors he may be helped in his work; yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the fruit of his Prayer, for he ſaith he muſt crave leave to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them, and all others, as he ſaith in the 43d page of the ſecond part of his book, and that you may know what his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and wherein he diſſents from all men; I will ſet down his own words in that place, <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>by the Wars of</hi> Alaricus,

            <p>In the 10th. page he ſaith, <hi>That Biſhop Mountague ſets down Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which this Biſhop complyes with, why the</hi> Turks <hi>ſhould rather be Antichriſt than the Pope, and his first Reaſon is, the</hi> Turks <hi>apoſtacy from the Doctrin and Goſpel of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, I dare not betray my Maſter Chriſt his truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt make bold to tell both the Biſhops that their firſt Reaſon hath no reaſon in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the <hi>Turk</hi> did never own Jeſus Chriſt, as he is truly Chriſt, to be King, Prieſt, and Prophet to his Church; the which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as for that Text you bring, which you ſay calls ſuch Reformers good men, as they were indeed, ſay you; But I know not who will believe it, for under favour, I muſt tell you, it is falſly applyed, for the Apoſtle there is foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what Antichriſt ſhould do when he came into the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould depart from the true Faith, and be a ſeducing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he ſhould be a lyer, an hypocrite, that his conſcience ſhould be ſeared, or benumbed in the practice of wickedneſſe, that he ſhould teach the Doctrine of Devils, as the forbiding of marriage, and commanding to abſtain from meats, which may be received with thankſgiving of them that believe and know the Truth.

Beſides, take notice he ſaith, <hi>The Leaders of the Church deceive the Church, therefore their Apoſtacy is the more excuſable:</hi> I beſeech you, whether is the greater Apoſtacy, of the Leaders of the people, that ſhould know the truth and teach others, for them to apoſtatize and draw multitudes after them, and for moſt part ſin againſt the light of their own Conſciences; or for ignorant common people to apoſtatize and ſin through ignorance, is not the apoſtacy of the Governors of the Church the greater, and doth the more miſchief, and leads the more aſtray? and yet this Biſhop ſaith, the apoſtacy of the Governors of the Church is more excuſable and leſſe abominable in the ſight of God: It ſeems he thinks that God ſeeth as he ſeeth; I will not ſay that this,

            <p>Page 71.

            <p>And he further ſaith, <hi>That</hi> Antiochus Epiphanes <hi>is as the little born, and that he was very little indeed at firſt, and was to come to his Kingdom by the deſtruction of other Kings,</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>are three Kings that fell before that born,</hi> and ſaith <hi>that</hi> Antiochus <hi>is the moſt lively type of Antichriſt that is in all the Scriptures,</hi>—which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the Parliament coming to this Kingdom.</p>

            <p n="2">2ly. I muſt tell you, that many godly and able Divines takes <hi>Antiochus</hi> to be rather a type of the kingdom of the Turks than, of Antichriſt, and Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, upon the 11th. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that many men are in doubt whether the things there ſpoken of belong to <hi>Antiochus</hi> or to ſome other King, and ſaith, that <hi>Calvin</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch that it can by no means be referred to <hi>Anticchus;</hi> for how ſhould he do what he liſt againſt God, when the ſhips of <hi>Shittim</hi> limited him, <hi>verſe</hi> 30. we will not deny, but, as you ſay, he was for a time one of the cruelleſt enemies to the Jewes that ever the Church had, and a Blaſphemer of God: but that doth not prove him neither to be the fourth Beaſt, to whom the ten horns belong, nor the little horn that ſprang up amongſt them;

               <hi>Daniel</hi> mentions another little horn that ſprang up among the ten, and which ſhould be diverſe from the firſt; and therefore I think it may rather be referred to Antichriſt the Pope, who is diverſe from all that were before him, becauſe of his double government, and he ſprang up among the ten hornes, that is, in the Roman Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, the which <hi>Antiochus</hi> did not, and it is true in the Pope which you apply to <hi>Antiochus</hi> page 71. that he was at firſt but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn, and had no right to the Kingdom, and Juriſdiction, and Authority that now he exerciſeth, for both his Civil and Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power is uſurped, but he grew up to ſuch dignity, that as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>His looks were more ſtout then his Fellows;</hi> for what Emperor or King was there in <hi>Europe</hi> but a few years ſince, that he did not look over with ſuch ſtoutneſſe, that he had them all at his beek, none durſt oppoſe him, for he had a mouth that ſpake great things, for he calls himſelf Univerſal Biſhop, and Chriſt's Vicar, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor: And ſpeaks great words againſt the moſt High, and wear out the Saints, ſpeaking preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly of his Apoſtolical Authority and power to forgive ſins, which is againſt the moſt High, for none can forgive ſins but God only: I could inlarge my ſelf much in theſe things, but I ſtrive for brevity.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this little Horn is to continue till the antient of dayes ſit, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 11. <hi>I beheld becauſe of the voice of the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous words which the Horn ſpake: and I beheld till the Beaſt was ſlain:</hi> Here the Horn is called the Beaſt, as Antichriſt is in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations;</hi> by the antient of daies ſitting, I conceive is not meant the day of the laſt Judgment, but the determined time appointed, that God will judge Antichriſt the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> at the pouring forth of the fifth Vial upon the Throne of the Beaſt, and that will when God ſhall put it into the heart of the ten Horns, that is, ten Kings belonging to that Monarchy, or that did belong unto it, which hitherto hath given their Kingdoms to the Beaſt, that is, their aid and aſſiſtance to maintain &amp; uphold the Pope in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, until the Word of God be fulfilled, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13, &amp; 17. for <hi>v.</hi> 16. the ten horns are they that ſhall hate the whore, &amp;c. for God is ſtrong that judgeth her, and ſo may well be made for the converſion of the Jewes, for when the antient of daies ſhall fit, and Judgment ſhall be given, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.22. in the Saints behalf, and the time come, ſaith the Text, that the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdom, as <hi>verſe</hi> 26, and 27.

            <p>Fifthly, Signs and wonders, all pretended to be done from God, to draw men to a good belief of all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if all theſe cannot ſerve the turn to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Adherents and Aſſiſtants, then</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Terrors and Tortures ſhall do the deed.</p>
            <p>Whence it is demanded if this ſix-fold Art was not moſt exquiſite in the Presbyterians, and the prevalent Faction of the Long Parliament?</p>
            <p>And the Queſtion is Anſwered and proved, that theſe ſix Arts, as you call them, are more exquiſitly to be found in Antichriſt the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> then they are to be found in theſe you name, or any others in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:151652:49"/>Firſt Antichriſts faigned and diſſembling ſanctity appears in making above fourſcore holy daies in a year, beſides Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath daies; which are kept and obſerved with no leſs reverence and devotion than the Lords day: and alſo his faigned diſſembling holy water, Croſſes, Crucifixes, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> beads, baptiſing of Bels, conſecrating of Altars, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the corporal body of Chriſt, the Chalice, the Linnen to cover the Altar; the Euchariſtical, the Senſor, Incenſe, the Cheſts or Coffers wherein the Saints bones are kept: Croſſes, Images, <hi>Eaſter</hi> Tapers, Fonts, Firſt-fruits, ſalt Church-yards: all theſe things are conſecrated, and theſe are but a part of Antichriſts faigned diſſembling ſanctity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His ſmoothneſs of language and fair ſpeeches, appears in that he calls himſelf Chriſts Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, a Father to the Church, and the people are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bears his name, Papiſts, from the name Pope, he tells them that he is the ſervant of all Chriſts ſervants, which if he were ſo indeed, as they believe him to be, this were ſufficient to make him to be as well thought on by all men, as he is by all his followers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His wit and Eloquence to perſwade men to aid him, appears in his inſinuating himſelf into the affections of Emperors, and Kings, and Clergy, &amp;c. calling them his moſt honourable and obedient Sons; as Pope <hi>Julius</hi> to the Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſalntes them thus, <hi>In that your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, my most honourable Sons, doth yield due reverence to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Chair; therein ye get unto your ſelves much reverence, for although it belong unto us eſpecially to ſit at the Helm, which we have taken upon us to govern in that holy Church where the holy Apostle ſate as Doctor, yet we acknowledge our ſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo great honour, Theodor.</hi> Book 5. and 9. I think he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wit and eloquence here, to get aid and aſſiſtance to ſet him a ſtep higher; and alſo in the benediction, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which he grants to his obedient Sons.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, His large promiſes and great gifts, appears in that he promiſes the pardon of ſins, and the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſuch promiſes are of great force with thoſe that believe that he hath power to do it; for to win men unto him, for he not only pardons what is paſt, but if they pleaſe him well, he will pardon ſins for a great while to come, and eſtabliſh Emperors and Kings in their Kingdoms, and if they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:151652:50"/>diſpleaſe him, he can ſoon turn them out, whether they belong to Church or State, and ſet up others in their ſtead; therefore it is no wonder if his promiſes and gifts gain men unto him, and ſeek all waies and means to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, His ſigns and wonders pretended to be done from God, appears in this, that whatſoever is done to confirm an errour, may be ſaid to be a fraudulent ſign or miracle, as to confirm their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His ſecond miracle, that he raiſed up a great Bull, that was killed by <hi>Zambres</hi> a Jewiſh Sorcerer: his third that he bound a Dragon after a miraculous manner; ſaith Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> in his confutation of <hi>Bellermin,</hi> theſe are ſome of Antichriſts ſigns and wonders.

            <p>Sixthly, If all theſe will not ſerve his turn, then terrours and torments muſt do it, and that appears firſt by his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring excommunications, as Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> ſaid in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Germans</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was ſtriken with a Thunderbolt, when he was excomunicated by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> that which once was ſaid of <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly applyed to Antichriſt the Pope; for his power was once extended ſo far, that all Nations feared before him, for whom he would he ſet up, and whom he would he pulled down; and <hi>Gentius</hi> King of <hi>Iliricum</hi> would not ſubmit to this Tyrant, until he was taken Priſoner to <hi>Rome</hi> with his Wife and Children: did not Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> cauſe <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to go barefoot with bleeding feet to <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> Tomb at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for diſpleaſing this Tyrant? and did not Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, becauſe King <hi>John</hi> would not ſubmit to him, at laſt ſo terrifie him, that he made him kneell down to <hi>Pandolphus</hi> his Legat and kiſs his foot, and alſo to kiſs <hi>Steven Langton;</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his foot? and Pope

            </p>
            <p>Page the 79. he ſaith the Apoſtle, in calling Antichriſt the Man of ſin, and not the Man of ſins; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. gives us to underſtand, and his meaning is, that Antichriſt ſhould commit ſome ſingular and peculiar, ſin, that ſhould only and properly be the ſin of the Antichriſt, and of none elſe; and which he ſaith is not the ſin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, nor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, nor Infidelity, nor blaſphemy, but the higheſt degree of man-ſlaughter, or the unjuſt murthering of an innocent Perſon; Page 80. and page 82. he ſaith it is worſe than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſin, and page 87. he further ſaith, this ſin is a judicial condemning of an innocent Perſon or Perſons, their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, (as Chriſt was) unto death, and that by a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer firſt to the latter part, how? or by what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? or what authority can be produced for proof of what he ſaith page 80. and 82. and 87? for his bare word is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for any man to pin their faith upon, without either Scripture or reaſon to confirm it, but ſuch fancies or fictions as theſe, you may remember that in his 65. page he calls them new delivered truths, and therefore ſaith, we ſhould recide from former errors or opinions, though never ſo generally embraced by former Authors; for he is the only man, for to find out a new Antichriſt, and to clear the old Antichriſt from that ſtain and polution, if any man will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, how can any man of any indifferent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, believe any thing that he writes, who doth ſo often,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151652:51"/>as you have heard, contradict himſelf and the Scriptures alſo? and ſo again, here in this place, where he ſaith the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand in that 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. that Antichriſt ſhall commit one ſingular peculiar ſin, that ſhould only and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be the ſin of Antichriſt, and none elſe: whereas nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that text, nor any other in the whole Scriptures, doth ſpeak of any ſingular or peculiar ſin that makes him to be Antichriſt; but the Scriptures ſpeak of many ſins, in many ſeveral places, that ſhould declare him to be the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, as is ſhewed in many places of this Book, and even in this Text from whence he would gather his aſſertion;
<note place="margin">His contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the Text ſpeaks the abſolute contrary: as firſt, that <hi>Antichrist ſhall exalt himſelf above all that is called God:</hi> Secondly, that he ſhould <hi>ſit in the Temple of God:</hi> Thirdly, that he ſhould <hi>ſhew himſelf that he is God;</hi> that is, the higheſt God on earth, above all other Gods either in Church or State: Fourthly, <hi>that his coming ſhould be, after the working of Satan, with power;</hi> and that is ſhewed above, how he claims and exerciſeth a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <hi>above all, &amp;c.</hi> Fifthly, that <hi>he ſhould come with ſigus:</hi> Sixthly, <hi>with lying:</hi> Seventhly, <hi>with working wonders, with deceit and unrighteouſneſs:</hi> Eightly, <hi>that he ſhould forſake the truth, and not receive it in love;</hi> beſides ſeveral ſins ſpoken of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. and all along in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and elſewhere, of many ſins that Antichriſt ſhould be known by: and this man rejects all, and will have him known by one ſingular, peculiar ſin, which no Text in all the Scripture, nor no Author that ever did write, did particularly point him out by, for if that had been the peculiar ſin to know him by, then ſhould they have been Antichriſt that crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, the Apoſtle would not after have writ of another Antichriſt, and which the ſame ſin ſhould make him Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; which never can the like be committed with ſuch a height of rebellion againſt God, and with ſuch a rage reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Heaven, by any other rebellion, or murther, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Parliament nor <hi>Phocas,</hi> or any elſe.</p>
            <p>And as our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was put to death by a Roman Power and Authority, I think we may upon better grounds than you bring, argue that it may imply thus much, that Antichriſt ſhould have his riſe, ſeat, and reſidence in that very place from whence the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority came, that crucified our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:151652:51"/>though there be no Text of Scripture to prove this, except perhaps it might be proved by conſequence, comparing Scripture with Scripture; yet I will not be curious to ſearch into it, but leave it to the judgment of others: however if I miſtake not it, it ſeems to carry more force in it, than all the new fangle ſtories you tell us of.</p>
            <p>Page 95. he draws a concluſion from the writings of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> that Antichriſt ſhall exalt himſelf above the Biſhops, and indeed, in this I grant that he ſaith very true, for the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſo exalted himſelf by his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Prieſt-hood, as head of the Church, and Chriſts Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, that he claims an authority over all the Biſhops in the World, and doth exerciſe that authority in many Kingdoms, more than any one doth beſides; and therefore by the Biſhops own argument the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the great Antichriſt and man of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Pope ſaith, it ſtandeth upon neceſſity to ſalvation, that every humane creature be ſubject unto him; and therefore requiſite and neceſſary for men that will be ſaved, to know the dignity of his See, and excellency of his Dominion, for his Prieſt-hood was prefigured in <hi>Aaron,</hi> and other Biſhops under him was prefigured by the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to be under him: thus he exalts himſelf above the Biſhops, as is ſaid before.</p>
            <p>Page 99. he ſaith that the denying Jeſus to be the Chriſt, is the proper note and undeniable mark of the great Antichriſt, who is the head of all other inferiour Antichriſts, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.22. <hi>Who is a lyer but he that denyeth that Jeſus is Christ, the ſame is Antichrist that denyeth the Father and the Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, I ſhall not trouble the Reader to relate what the Biſhop ſaith from this Text to the purpoſe he aims at, but I ſhall (as I have done by other Texts and Arguments) ſhew you how undeniable this Text rightly applyed doth prove the Pope to be Antichriſt: firſt, he is ſaid in this Text to be a lyar, and ſo in the Text before named 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. that is, a crafty deceiver of the People, by granting pardons and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and many other priviledges which are ſo well known I need not repeat them, and which are all as ſo many lies, for there is no truth in them; nor no Scripture to prove that he hath any ſuch power or authority, but that by his lies he cauſeth the People to believe him; and he is a lyar alſo, in profeſſing outwardly in words, what he denieth in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151652:52"/>his practice, as might be made appear in many ſeveral things, and as appears in the former part of this Book; <hi>he is a lyar that denies Jefus to be Christ:</hi> Jeſus ſignifies a Saviour, <hi>thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſine;</hi> and Chriſt fignifies anointed, that is, to be King, Prieſt and Prophet to his Church; a King to rule and govern his Church, to appoint Laws, and Officers, and Ordinances in the Church; a Prieſt to offer Sacrifice for the ſins of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that he did, eſpecially when he offered himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. <hi>If the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh: how much more ſhall the blood of Jeſus Christ, who through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, cleanſe your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi> 3ly He is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to teach &amp; inſtruct his Church; every man would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have him for their Jeſus to ſave them from their ſins, but few are willing to have him for their Chriſt, that is, to be their King, Prieſt and Prophet, to rule and govern, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And firſt, the Pope denies Chriſt his Kingly office in his Church, to rule and govern it by his own inſtituted Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Officers, &amp;c. for the Pope hath in his Church one hundred and fifty ſeveral Orders of Church-Officers and religious Orders, which not one of them is of Chriſt nor his Apoſtles inſtitution, which in the former part is nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by their names. Secondly, the Pope denies Chriſt his Kingly office, in challenging an univerſal Power and Authority over all Churches; which Power and Authority belongs only unto Chriſt,
<note place="margin">The Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Chriſt his Kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> and not to any man upon earth: Thirdly, in making his Laws and Decrees equal or rather above the Decrees and inſtitutions of Chriſt; for the Popes Laws are obſerved, as forbiding marriage, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to abſtain from meats, and many other the like; and Chriſts Laws are rejected that doth allow of theſe things, which the Pope prohibits; and forbideth many things, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, worſhiping of Images, Adultery and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and many the like, which the Pope alloweth: thus Gods Law is neglected, and the Popes obſerved: Fourthly, the Pope denies Chriſts Kingly office in his inſtituted Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, by eſtabliſhing his own humane inventions, of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Croſſes, Crucifixes, Prayer upon beads, and in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, Pilgrimages, Conjuration or exorciſm and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151652:52"/>the like, and ſeting up a religion compoſed of above forty hereſies, as is named and ſhewed before: And fifthly, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying and bloting out the ſecond Commandment, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the worſhip of falſe Gods, or of the true God in a falſe way, and giving the worſhip and honour that is due to God to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Saints and Images; all which is a denying of Chriſt his Kingly rule and Government; and which makes the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the great Antichriſt here ſpoken of in this Text, as well as in others before nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> denies Chriſt the exerciſe of his Prieſtly office, for firſt, whereas it is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>that Christ is entred into Heaven to appear in the preſence of God for us, not that he ſhould offer himſelf often, for then must he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world:</hi> and Chap. 10.14. <hi>for with one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi> but this the Pope denies in his practice,
<note place="margin">The Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Chriſt in his Prieſtly office.</note> that Chriſts once offering himſelf is ſatisfactory to take away ſin; and therefore he is offered again by the Papiſts every day, and ſometimes in many thouſand places in one day, in their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Maſſes, from which practice of theirs I ſhall propound one queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> where, or what Text of Scripture can they or any man bring to prove, that either the Pope or any of his ſhaveling Prieſts, Jeſuites or Friers, are commanded to offer Jeſus Chriſt an unbloudy propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick and the dead? or in what part of Scripture are the maſſing Prieſts called Sacrificers in the New Teſtament, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſacrifice Jeſus Chriſt? or did ever the Apoſtles offer Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt a Sacrifice for the quick and dead? if theſe things cannot be proved by Scripture to be of Chriſts inſtitutions, then it cannot be denyed but the Pope doth deny Chriſt both of his Kingly and Prieſtly offices, and ſo he is the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and man of ſin that was prophecyed of, to come into the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Pope and all Papiſts deny Chriſt his Prieſtly office in offering up their prayers to God in any other name or by any other interceſſor or mediator but Jeſus Chriſt only, <hi>John</hi> 16.23. <hi>verily verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name he will give it you;</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14. <hi>this is the aſſurance that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us;</hi> but we have no aſſurance
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151652:53"/>in any text of Scripture to be heard in the name of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> nor any other Saint, nor no Scripture to prove that to ask in their name, or to make them mediators, or ſhe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatrix, as they call the Virgin; no Scripture proves it to be according to his will, and therefore have no promiſe to be heard with acceptance; for there is no other Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, but the man Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. ſo that by theſe Scriptures it is clear that the Pope doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and deny Jeſus Chriſt in his Prieſtly office; and not only ſo, but the Pope is guilty of the ſins of many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more, whom he doth make to deny Chriſt in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Prieſtly offices, and leads them without repentance to deſtruction with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> denies Jeſus to be Chriſt, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Chriſt the exerciſe of his Prophetical office, to teach and inſtruct his Church, for whereas all the Service and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is given and done to God, ought in every thing, to be performed, both as to the matter and the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance according to the word of God, and the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and their inſtitutions; both for Ordinances, Officers and Offices; the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not, ſo far as I know, perform any one part of Gods worſhip and ſervice in any one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

            <p>Theſe as you have heard are ſome of the Doctrines and of their practice, whereby Antichriſt the Pope doth in a moſt high and contemptuous manner rejects and denie Jeſus to be the Chriſt; and will not allow of thoſe Ordinances and Officers of the Church, which Chriſt hath taught us in the New Teſtament and inſtituted for the Churches uſe;
<note place="margin">Antichriſt ſound out who he is.</note> but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt the Pope hath framed a new form of worſhip, with new Ordinances and Officers, teaching for Doctrines his own precepts and inventions, ſo that now we have found out the great abominable Antichriſt, that doth in the higheſt and moſt contemptible manner of any one in the world reject and deny Jeſus to be the Chriſt annointed of the Father, King, Prieſt, and Prophet to his Church: and therefore we may conclude that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the great lyar and the Antichriſt.</p>

            <p>I anſwer, that what is ſaid before might be a ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, but beſides I ſhall diſprove what he ſaith, in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> for <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> after he came to reign, he made war againſt the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and wone many ſtrong Cities, and took away the ſpoil of the Land, and returned in the year 143, and went up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> verſe 21, 22. and Chap. 3. verſe 37. <hi>the King took the half of the Hoaſt, and departed from</hi> Antiochia <hi>his royal City, in the year</hi> 147. <hi>and</hi> Lyfias <hi>whom the King left Overſeer of his buſineſs, at the ſame time ſent</hi> Ptomeas, Nicanor <hi>and</hi> Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius <hi>with forty thouſand footmen, and ſeven thouſand Horſemen into the Land of</hi> Juda, <hi>which Army was defeated:</hi> then Chap. 4.28, <hi>the next year following gathered</hi> Lyſius <hi>threeſcore thouſand footmen and five thouſand horſemen to fight againſt</hi> Jeruſalem: and Chap. 6.16. Antiochus <hi>died in the</hi> 149. <hi>year of his reign;</hi> that was ſix years he reigned after he made war againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> beſides the time he reigned when he made war againſt <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and took many Cities and brought away the ſpoil; and this is but all three years and an half with our Biſhop, if you will believe him; which theſe chapters makes it appear to be fix years.</p>
